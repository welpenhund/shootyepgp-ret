# Modified for RET, Twow guild in Tel'abim
## Roll commands for RET

# shootyepgp
Guild Helper addon for EPGP loot system in WoW (1.12)

## setup
shootyepgp requires some modifications to guild permissions for officer notes by the guild leader.  

### Version 3.x (current)
- officer notes must be set to visible by all and editable **only** by the EPGP admins (eg. officer rank+)
- public notes are not in use by the addon

#### _Version 2.x (deprecated)_ 
- _public and officer notes must be set to visible by all._
- _both public and officer notes **must** be editable **only** by the EPGP admins (eg. officer rank+)_

## tips
Create a new chatframe (right-click > create new window on chat tab) and name it `debug` (capitalization doesn't matter)  
Most of the information messages will now print on that frame and not clutter your default chatframe.

## usage
Right-click on minimap or FuBar shootyepgp icon will show all available settings.  
Left-click shows the standings window with everyone's EP, GP and PR values. 
The standings window can also be toggled with **/shooty show** chat command. 

## features
- EPGP standings list (all)
- Simple chatlink click to bid on items (all)
- Item Bids list (admin/ML)
- Item GP prices on item tooltips (all)
- Export standings to csv (all)
- Configurable EPGP Decay (admin)
- Configurable Offspec discount (admin)
- Guild Progression multiplier (admin)
- Reserves - *standby list EP* - with alts support (admin and all)

Addon has been designed so that basic member functionality is usable even without the addon. 
- `/w <masterlooter name> +` (for main spec) or `/w <masterlooter name> -` (for off spec) after the loot officer links a piece of loot and asks for bids in raid chat.  
- Type `/x +` (where x is the number of the custom channel) or `/x +MainName` if on an alt to respond to a standby list afk check.  
Having the addon makes everything more convenient, but is not mandatory.
